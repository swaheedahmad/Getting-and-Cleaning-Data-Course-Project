Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

Download the dataset in the working directory
Loads both the training and test datasets, 
Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
Merges the two datasets
Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The end result is shown in the file datasetTidy.txt.

CodeBook.md describes the how to use all this, variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses. 

The final output is called secTidySet.txt.
